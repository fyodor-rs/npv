        <h1>Bitvise SSH Client: Installed resources</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="content">
        <h1 class='chapter'>Components that can be used directly</h1>

        <h1>BvSsh.exe</h1>
        <p>Our general-purpose, graphical SSH client. Supports terminal shell, graphical SFTP file transfers, single-click Remote Desktop tunneling, bridging of FTP clients to SFTP, port forwarding with static rules and via integrated proxy, and remote administration of Bitvise SSH Server.</p>

        <h1>BvSshCtrl.exe, BvSshCtrl.cpp</h1>
        <p>Bitvise SSH Client Control utility - run <i>BvSshCtrl</i> without parameters for help. C++ source code is provided.</p>

        <h1>sftpc.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line SFTP client with built-in scripting support. Run it with <i>sftpc -h</i> for help.</p>

        <h1>stermc.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line terminal client. Run it with <i>stermc -h</i> for help.</p>

        <h1>sexec.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line scriptable remote execution client. Run it with <i>sexec -h</i> for help.</p>

        <h1>stnlc.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line scriptable port forwarding and FTP-to-SFTP bridge client. Run it with <i>stnlc -h</i> for help.</p>

        <h1>spksc.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line scriptable SSH Public Key Subsystem client. Run it with <i>spksc -h</i> for help.</p>

        <h1>log.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line utility to redirect a program's output into a uniquely named log file. Suitable for use with <i>sftpc</i> as well as any other command-line program. Run it without parameters for help.</p>

        <h1>retry.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line utility that repeatedly executes the provided command until it succeeds, or a maximum number of attempts have been made. Suitable for use with <i>sftpc</i> as well as any other command-line program. Run it without parameters for help.</p>

        <h1>BvInputDiag.exe</h1>
        <p>Command-line utility to display keyboard and mouse input for diagnostic purposes.</p>

        <h1>uninst.exe</h1>
        <p>Bitvise SSH Client uninstaller. It is not usually run directly. Instead, use <b>Add or remove programs</b> in Windows.</p>
        <p>To uninstall Bitvise SSH Client in an unattended manner:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Copy <i>uninst.exe</i> from the Bitvise SSH Client installation directory to another temporary location.</p></li>
            <li><p>Run it in the temporary folder as follows:</p>
                <p>uninst "BvSshClient" -unat</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is possible to run <i>uninst</i> directly from the SSH Client installation directory. However if you do that, <i>uninst</i> will first copy itself to a temporary location, then run itself and exit. The original instance of <i>uninst</i> will exit before the uninstallation completes. This may cause problems if your script performs other tasks which should wait for the uninstallation.</p>


        <h1 class='chapter'>Components for use by developers</h1>

        <h1>FlowSshNetSamples: FlowSshNet_Exec.ps1, FlowSshNet_Sftp.ps1</h1>
        <p>PowerShell scripts demonstrating use of the FlowSsh library for .NET included with the SSH Client. The Exec script shows how to execute a remote command. The Sftp script shows how to transfer files.</p>
        <p>The functionality available via PowerShell + FlowSshNet is similar to that available via <i>sexec</i> and <i>sftpc</i> command line clients. FlowSshNet provides a greater degree of control to advanced users.</p>

        <h1>FlowSshC32/64.dll, FlowSshNet32/64.dll, FlowSshNet32/64.msi</h1>
        <p>Native DLL, .NET assemblies, and installers that comprise the FlowSshC and FlowSshNet libraries.</p>
        <p>FlowSshNet can be used under the Bitvise SSH Client license on computers where the SSH Client is installed. A separate FlowSsh license is required for use without Bitvise SSH Client.</p>

        <h1>install.log</h1>
        <p>An installation log file that may be present and contain information if FlowSshNet installation did not complete correctly.</p>


        <h1 class='chapter'>Components that should NOT be executed directly</h1>

        <h1>bvtermc.exe, totermc.exe, totermw.exe</h1>
        <p>The SSH Client's terminal subsystem modules. Used only from within the the SSH Client.</p>

        <h1>WRC-5.xx, WRC-6.xx, WRC-7.xx</h1>
        <p>Bitvise SSH Server Remote Control packages. Can be used from the graphical SSH Client for remote administration of Bitvise SSH Server or WinSSHD 5.xx, 6.xx, and 7.xx.</p>

        <h1>MstscTitle32/64.dll/exe</h1>
        <p>Fixes Remote Desktop window titles when using single-click Remote Desktop forwarding.</p>

        <h1>BscActCode.exe</h1>
        <p>Bitvise SSH Client's activation code manager. Used to apply an activation code so that it's effective machine-wide, instead of only for the current user.</p>

        <h1>BvDump32.exe, BvDump64.exe</h1>
        <p>In the event that an SSH Client process encounters a critical error, this executable is run to create a memory dump of the process that encountered the error. Any memory dumps are stored on the local computer under the current user's %LOCALAPPDATA% directory, under Bitvise\BvDump. If you ever see an error of this type, please contact Bitvise.</p>

        <h1>CiCpFips32.dll, CiCpFips64.dll, CryptoPP530Fips32.dll, CryptoPP530Fips64.dll</h1>
        <p>The SSH Client's older cryptographic provider as used in 6.xx versions. CiCpFips32/64.dll serve as an interface to CryptoPP530Fips32/64.dll, a version of Crypto++ that originally received FIPS 140-2 validation under certificate 819.</p>
        <p>This provider should only be used where needed. It contains known issues with timing side channels, which can permit remote private key compromise. Our software implements mitigations, but it is better to use the new provider, CiWinCng.</p>
        <p>By default, this cryptographic provider is used on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, where Windows CNG cryptography is not available. On later Windows versions, this provider can be selected by creating a registry value named "CryptoProvider", with string value "CiCpFips", under the registry key HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Bitvise on 64-bit systems, or HKLM\Software\Bitvise on 32-bit systems. This registry value will have machine-wide effect on Bitvise SSH Server, SSH Client, and FlowSsh versions 7.xx and higher.</p>

        <h1>CiWinCng32.dll, CiWinCng64.dll</h1>
        <p>The SSH Client's default cryptographic provider used on all recent versions of Windows, starting from Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.</p>
        <p>This provider uses <b>Windows CNG cryptography</b> for algorithms supported by Windows. It is augmented with <b>OpenSSL</b> and Crypto++ to support algorithms not supported by Windows.</p>
        <p>If FIPS mode is enabled in Windows security policy, this provider uses <b>only</b> Windows CNG cryptography. In FIPS mode, only algorithms supported by Windows are available.</p>
